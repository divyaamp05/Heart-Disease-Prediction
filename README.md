# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This repository contains code for predicting the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of data collected from various patients, including features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate achieved, etc. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Code

The main code for heart disease prediction is implemented in `Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb`. 
This Jupyter Notebook contains the following sections:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loading the dataset and preprocessing the data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset and analyzing it.
3. Model Training: Training machine learning model with Logistic Regression
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.
5. Building Predictive System: Focuses on building a predictive system using machine learning techniques to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage

To run the code, ensure you have all the dependencies installed. Then, simply open the `Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and execute each cell sequentially. You can also customize and experiment with the code as needed.

## Contributions

Contributions to improve the project are welcome! Feel free to submit issues for bugs or feature requests, and pull requests are encouraged for implementing new features or addressing existing issues.
